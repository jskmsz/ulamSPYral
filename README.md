# ulamSPYral
A simple Python code that plots Ulam's spiral

The code was written with PT-PT comments, but one can be able to translate them, nothing very trivial.
Simply define the length of the spiral, that is, the ending number, then it will plot only prime numbers, resolving the beautiful spiral. Not very pythonic, it was just a side quest instead of focusing on my final paper (but, as for now, it is done, good and proper!).
